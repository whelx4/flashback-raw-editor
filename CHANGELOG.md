# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Redeveloped the product around finished Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P43 JPEGs; removed
  connected-Flashback import and DNG export from the normal Windows and Apple flows.
- Added EXIF-based P43 recognition and metadata-preserving Windows JPEG export.
- Reduced the default filter intensity from 100% to 60% so presets do not
  overpower the P43's baked CCD, flash, sharpening, and white-balance character.
- Added an **Open P43 folder** Windows workflow and produced a fresh packaged EXE.
- Made the SwiftUI application universal for iPhone and iPad, with native Photos
  and Files import plus add-only Photos export.
- Renamed the mobile processor around finished images and removed its RAW-specific
  ONE35 exposure path.
- Updated the unsigned GitHub build to emit one universal AltStore IPA.
- Refocused the public catalog to 20 disposable-film, half-frame, toy-digital,
  paper-camera, and DonCamera-inspired looks; Flashback Classic is no longer public.
- Split look construction into reusable color, optical and texture profiles.
- Moved halation out of the cached source and into the preset render, fixing
  preset switching and guaranteeing that 0% intensity is neutral.
- Added arbitrary RGB vignette tint, film-grain scale, deterministic digital
  luma/chroma noise and source-aware final JPEG character.
- Extended the iOS Core Image renderer to consume the same profile metadata and
  approximate the Windows optical/texture stages.
- Completed the iOS Photo Lab → develop → Gallery loop with persistent JPEGs,
  sharing, and press-to-compare previews.
- Added iOS-specific linear-input LUT companions and corrected `.cube` versus
  Core Image axis ordering so mobile no longer swaps LUT dimensions.
- Added a packaged-build smoke-test mode and verified the Windows onedir bundle
  with all 21 LUTs and GPU shader resources.

## 1.6.6 — 2026-07-25

A maintenance release: two DNG fixes, and thumbnails that stop re-reading the
same files every time you switch vibe.

### Fixes
- **Fixed DNG export producing broken files for already-imported captures.**
  Camera-original DNGs keep the raw sensor data in the first image block, but the
  DNGs Flashback writes put an RGB preview there and move the raw further in.
  Export > DNG > Process always read the first block, so re-exporting a capture
  that had already been imported packaged the *preview* as if it were sensor
  data — producing sub-1MB files that no raw editor could open. Export now finds
  the raw block by looking for it rather than assuming its position, and a
  re-export is byte-identical to the first one. Importing was never affected.
- **Import now honours your DNG profile name.** The profile name decides which
  profile Camera Raw and Lightroom bind a file to. Export > DNG used your
  setting, but camera import ignored it and always wrote the shipped default, so
  files that came in through the camera silently disagreed with files you
  exported. Both paths now use the name you set. The default is unchanged.

### Performance
- **Switching vibe no longer re-reads every V1 negative on disk.** Detecting a V1
  negative means reading its sidecar file, and the thumbnail pass asked once per
  frame — so a full roll re-read every sidecar on every vibe change. The answer
  is now remembered for the session (and refreshed when a roll is imported).

### Under the hood
- Removed five pieces of state that were set but never read — leftovers carried
  over from before the modular rewrite. No behaviour change.

## 1.6.5 — 2026-06-18

A reworked halation that behaves like real film: a defined, photographic glow
around highlights instead of a soft bloom, with control over its colour.

### Halation rework
- **Rebuilt halation on a physically-grounded model.** Film halation is light
  that passes through the emulsion, reflects off the film base, and re-exposes
  the frame — geometrically an *out-of-focus copy* of the highlights. The glow's
  core is now a defocus disc (a circle of confusion) with a **defined edge**, the
  way real no-remjet stocks like CineStill look, rather than the old soft Gaussian
  bloom. Fainter exponential "scatter" tails sit underneath for the diffuse falloff,
  and the glow is added in linear light, so it stays punchy around bright sources.
- **New Warmth control.** Halation now reddens *outward* — a near-neutral core
  shading to a red-orange halo, matching the colour of real back-reflection.
  Warmth sets how saturated that is: 100% is the physical baseline (and reproduces
  the previous look's average colour), 0% is a colourless glow, and higher values
  push toward the saturated no-remjet / CineStill halo.
- Existing vibes carry over unchanged — Threshold, Blur Radius and Strength keep
  their units and meaning; Warmth simply starts at its default on older presets.

### Fixes
- **Generic (non-Flashback) raws now receive halation.** The develop path for
  imported third-party raws skipped the halation bake entirely, so those files got
  no glow regardless of the vibe. They now bake halation like every other path.
- **Fixed cyan-tinted highlights on some Apple Silicon Macs.** Clipped highlights
  in Flashback Camera files could render with a cyan cast on certain M-series GPUs
  (seen on M1; M3 and Windows rendered correctly). Out-of-range values in the GPU
  colour math were handled differently across Apple GPU generations; the pipeline
  now sanitises them, so highlights render identically on all hardware.

### Under the hood
- The "running on CPU" banner now also covers a forced CPU-only mode
  (`LOFILOGIC_FORCE_CPU`) used for debugging, with a message that distinguishes
  it from a real GPU problem — so a deliberate CPU run can't be mistaken for a
  driver fault.

## 1.6.0 — 2026-06-17

Broader camera support, smarter exposure for generic raws, and two memory fixes —
including one that could drive the app to many gigabytes and out of memory.

### Raw format support
- **Greatly expanded the import whitelist** — most formats libraw can decode now
  open (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic, Leica, Pentax, Hasselblad,
  Phase One, Kodak, Sigma, GoPro, and more). The decode itself is the gate: an
  unsupported or corrupt file surfaces as a clean miss instead of being pre-rejected.

### Exposure
- **Tiered exposure for non-Flashback raws.** DNGs read their embedded
  `BaselineExposure` (Tier 1); a few proprietary formats use a measured per-make
  residual (Tier 2); unknown bodies now apply **no** per-camera lift (Tier 3),
  which stops unmeasured raws from reading hot. A constant anchor re-aligns the
  libraw linear develop to the mid-grey the pipeline expects.
- **Exposure slider range widened to ±3 stops** (was ±2). Existing projects load
  unchanged — saved values keep their exact exposure.

### Fixes
- **Fixed a GPU memory leak that could exhaust system RAM.** The per-render texture
  arena pooled resources by image resolution and never released them, so browsing
  raws of differing sizes accumulated GPU memory without bound — on unified-memory
  Macs that is system RAM. Stale pools are now freed on resolution change.
- **Removing an image no longer leaves its thumbnail behind.** An LRU-cache `pop`
  raised instead of returning its default, aborting removal partway (backspace and
  drag-out both affected).
- **Developing overlay dims the whole window again.** The fade animated a child
  widget's window opacity, which composites wrong on macOS — the darkening
  collapsed to just the spinner and text mid-load. It now fades via a graphics
  effect that covers the full window.

### Under the hood
- Image/preview/thumbnail caches now share one **RAM-relative memory budget**
  (a quarter of system RAM, backing off live as other apps need memory) with
  LRU eviction across caches, so resident cache memory stays bounded.

## 1.5.0 — 2026-06-11

The largest release so far, and the first under the new name. Highlights: a full
colour-pipeline rewrite around ACEScg and the DNG dual-illuminant spec, a
GPU-resident render that's several times faster, support for the original ONE35
(V1) negatives, a reworked film look, and project files + camera import.

> **Upgrading from 1.1.2:** saved settings migrate automatically on first launch.
> Custom `.cube` LUTs are reset to the vibe's factory LUT (a pre-1.5 LUT was built
> against the old pipeline and would look ~2 stops over) — the original path is
> kept so you can re-import once regenerated. TIFF *import* is no longer supported;
> open the original DNG instead.

### Renamed to LoFi Logic
- The app is now **LoFi Logic** — "Flashback" is the camera; this is an independent
  editor for it. Preferences and saved vibes carry over on first launch.
- Project files use the **`.lofi`** extension (older `.fbproj` still opens) and open
  by double-click once associated (the installers register the type).

### Colour pipeline (v2)
- New working space: **linear ACEScg (AP1)**. Raw develops through DNG forward
  matrices to XYZ_D50, Bradford-adapts to D60, with per-channel Planckian white
  balance — replacing the old Rec.2020 chain.
- **Highlight recovery** (darktable-style "inpaint opposed") reconstructs clipped
  channels pre-white-balance, so blown highlights keep their hue.
- Chroma noise reduction moved to **Lab space**; bloom uses ACEScg luma weights.
- **Generic raw** (Canon, Nikon, Sony, Fujifilm, Olympus, Panasonic, …) reworked
  onto the v2 pipeline with a per-make baseline EV nudge so different bodies land
  near the same mid-grey. Still a best-effort match, not a per-camera calibration.

### Performance
- **GPU-resident render:** the whole effect chain runs on the GPU with a single
  upload and readback instead of bouncing each effect through the CPU. Full-quality
  renders dropped from ~2.3 s to ~0.3 s (Windows / RTX 3090) and ~0.48 s to ~0.11 s
  (Apple Silicon). The CPU path is kept as the reference oracle and an automatic
  fallback when no GPU is available.
- A per-render resource arena removes per-frame allocation churn; load-time halation
  is ~⅓ faster. Returning to an already-viewed image is now instant (cached preview).

### The film look
- **Chromatic aberration is now spectral** — a continuous purple→green fringe like
  real glass, in the physically-correct direction and orientation-invariant.
- **Bloom is generated after vignette**, so dimmed edges glow less and bloom
  concentrates where the image is actually bright.
- New **edge (corner) softness** effect (lens field-curvature look; off by default).
- Stronger chroma noise reduction at high settings; calmer Zen-mode exposure drag.

### Flashback ONE35 V1 support
- Opens **V1 negatives** — the headerless 8-bit raw the first-gen ONE35 exports.
  Drop a roll's `.zip` (or an extracted folder); frames develop to the same ACEScg
  intermediate as V2, so every slider, vibe, and LUT behaves identically.
- The **disposable** vibe uses a V1-tuned LUT so the look holds up on V1's flatter
  capture. Re-importing a roll never overwrites existing files.

### Editor
- **Project files**, **Open Recent**, and **Save / Save As** (Cmd/Ctrl+S).
- **Camera import:** connect a ONE35 and the roll is archived into dated folders,
  skipping anything already imported; import and export folders are separate and
  configurable.
- **Curation:** Delete/Backspace or drag a thumbnail off the strip to remove a frame
  (works in Zen mode too). Image lists always sort alphabetically.

### Advanced panel & export
- Every effect control now uses **user-facing units** (percent, pixels, EV); vignette
  feather is replaced by a signed **Vignette Curve**.
- LUTs are referenced by a **tagged id** (`factory:` / `user:`) so an in-place upgrade
  can't load the wrong file.
- **Stable, aesthetic export names** derived from the source — `FBV2_<frame>` /
  `FBV1_<roll>_<frame>` plus a per-vibe suffix — so the "already processed" check works.
- **ACEScct TIFF export** (for building LUTs in DaVinci Resolve) now exports at the
  app's standard exposure by default; reverse-AE is an opt-in for film-stock profiling.
- **Exported DNGs keep their exposure** (`ExposureTime` written to the standard Exif
  location, read by Adobe / Camera Raw); `CalibrationIlluminant1` corrected to D50.

### Install & platform
- **Parallel installs:** each release installs side by side under its own version,
  with versioned artifacts (`LoFiLogic-macOS-…`, `-Windows-Setup-…`, `-Linux-…`).
- The Windows uninstaller can optionally remove just this version's settings.
- **GPU diagnostics:** the app reports how the GPU resolved and shows a banner if it
  falls back to software / CPU (usually a missing `pip install` when run from source).

### Fixes
- Fixed a **Vulkan startup crash** ("Expression is not cached!") from the CNR shader;
  every shader is now compile-checked in CI against software Vulkan.
- Vignette no longer blackens extreme corners on some GPUs (corner-case NaN).
- **Sony ARW** files no longer render near-black (G2 white-balance sentinel preserved).
- Linux AppImage launcher corrected to run from its own bundled contents.

### Under the hood
- Internals split into **`VibeConfig`** (the film-stock layer) and **`ImageAdjustments`**
  (per-image edits), removing a class of mid-render slider races.
- **Test suite + CI** (pytest, plus a shader-compile job); GPL-3.0 license; new
  developer docs (architecture + build/test guide).

### Notes
- **Linux is best-effort** — the AppImage is built in CI but not yet hardware-tested;
  on Steam Deck / immutable systems use `--appimage-extract-and-run` if FUSE is missing.
